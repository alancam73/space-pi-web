## Overview
Simple Javascript static website to slideshow thru Space images with PIes overlaid
Deployed via AWS S3 and CloudFront for regional caching performance.


## Dependent Repositories
To complete the picture you also need: -

https://github.com/alancam73/space-pi-lambda - Amazon Rekognition based Lambda to detect PIes in Space images



## Pre-requisites
* AWS Account
* S3 bucket - same as the bucket specified in the environment parameter of space-pi-lambda
   * images/ - various images of Space with (or without!) pies. (Upload your own images for your use-case)
   * index.html - website main index
   * slideshow.js - logic to rotate thru images and reference the Rekognition pie-count
   * images.txt - file that gets generated by space-pi-lambda with a Reko pie count per image


## Setup 
1. follow the steps in https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-serve-static-website/ to create a static S3 website with the above content, and leverage CloudFront CDN. Make sure the bucket policy allows the CloudFront distribution to get the objects in the bucket. Public access can/should be blocked (since only CloudFront needs to access the source/origin bucket)
2. if unexpected results make sure you have a valid images.txt - if not then ensure you have run the space-pi-lambda successfully
